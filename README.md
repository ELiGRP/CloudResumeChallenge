# CloudResumeChallenge
Welcome


This repository contains all the code I used to complete the Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazael 

The Front End is a simple site written in HTML and CSS.

The Back End consists of a DynamoDB table, an API Gateway, and a Lambda function written in Python. The services are all written in HCL as Terraform files.
